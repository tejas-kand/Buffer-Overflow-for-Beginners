<h1>Exploit Development - Buffer-Overflow For Beginner </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>

I am a beginner in Info-sec community and as a fellow beginner, I spend some of my time in Wep Application Pentesting and my personal favorite Binary Exploitation.
I was working on a Vulnerable Box ([Vulnserver](https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html)) which I found interesting since it involves reverse engineering windows executables and creating exploit scripts for Buffer-Overflows.
As the legends say, ***"The best way to learn is to teach"***, I wrote all these scripts for those who are new in buffer overflow exploit development. Let have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ
