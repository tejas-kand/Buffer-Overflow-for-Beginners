<h1>Exploit Development - Buffer-Overflow For Beginner </h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>

I am a beginner in Info-sec community and as a fellow beginner, I spend some of my time in **Wep Application Pentesting** and my personal favorite **Binary Exploitation.**
I was working on a Vulnerable Box ([Vulnserver](https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html)) which I found interesting since it involves reverse engineering windows executables and creating exploit scripts for Buffer-Overflows.

**Requirements:**
1. Windows 10 x64-bit (also works with older version).
2. Vulnserver (link above)
3. [Immunity Debugger](https://debugger.immunityinc.com/ID_register.py)
4. Will to explore the Art of Binary Exploitation.

As the legends say, ***"The best way to learn is to teach"***, I wrote all these scripts for those who are new in buffer overflow exploit development. Let have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ

As a complete beginner, Knowledge of CPU Registers and How memory works is mandatory. For that, I have a complete series of writeups along with its documentation on my [medium](https://medium.com/@tejas.kand.45) profile.

All the source code used in this documentation can be found in the [scripts](/scripts/) folder, including the windows executable.
